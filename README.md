## Notes

I had a few issues with the tab bar controller and the navigation controller. It's very confused how to properly set them up and access
the navigation controller in a programatic way.

I also wasn't sure about the scroll view of the detail view controller. It is scrolling but the scroll view doesn't move up and down as the example gif. Is that required ?
